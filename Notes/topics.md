# Guido_Van_Rossum
Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer who is best known as the creator of the Python programming language. He was born on January 31, 1956, in the Netherlands, and he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam.

Van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a programming language that was easy to learn, yet powerful and flexible enough to be used for a wide range of applications.

Python was first released in 1991, and since then it has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with applications ranging from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.

Van Rossum worked on Python for many years, serving as its lead developer until he retired from the position in 2018. He has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to computer science, including the ACM Software System Award in 2019.
